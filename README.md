# [Flex] Phase 1 Project Review Guidelines

## Project Requirements

Make sure your project meets all the project requirements. Here's a link to the
project guidelines:

- [Phase 1 Project Guidelines](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/phase-1-javascript-project-mode)

We also expect you to complete the following items prior to scheduling the
review:

- **[GITHUB REPOSITORY]: A well-written informative README.md file**. This is
  the business card of your project and you really want it to look great! A
  template can be found here: [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/).
  Some additional considerations:
  - If you used someone else's pictures or material please make sure you give
  them credit in your README.
  - If you think your blog post and/or video are really good and would add
  value, add them to your README.md.
  - If you want to go above and beyond, record a few seconds of yourself
  navigating the app and turn it into a gif. Then, add the gif in your
  README.md. That way anyone can get a sense of how your app works without
  leaving the README's page on GitHub!
- **[GITHUB REPOSITORY]: A detailed commit history (30+ commits is your minimum
  goal)**. Committing frequently is a fundamental best practice that you want to
  acquire as soon as possible. One day you will be collaborating on projects and
  you'll notice the importance of committing even more. Commit messages should
  be in the present tense, 50 characters or less and they should describe the
  changes you are committing.
- **A video walkthrough of your app — MUST be no longer than 3 minutes**. In
  the video try to sound as professional as possible and walk through the
  functionality you built. A common way to record the video is to open a zoom
  meeting, share your screen, and then hit "record". Once the recording has been
  downloaded to your computer, upload it to YouTube Studio as "unlisted". That
  way only people with the link will be able to watch it. You don't have to
  share the video with anyone other than Flatiron if you don't feel comfortable.
- **A blog post about this phase of the curriculum**. This will serve as one of
  the five blogs you are required to complete to graduate from Flatiron School.
  The blog post MUST meet the following requirements:
  - Each blog must be at least 750 words, which is an approximately 3-5 minute
read on a blogging platform.
  - Blogs must be about a technical aspect related to the curriculum Phase.
  - Blog topics may be related to your project but this is not required or
expected.
  - Your blog must include code snippets or screenshots.
  - If you need support on grammar, we encourage you to use a grammar service
such as www.grammarly.com or something similar.

  Please use these [Guidelines][blog-guidelines] and [Tips][blog-tips] for
reference as you start blogging!

## Scheduling Your Review

Please make sure you have satisfied all the requirements listed in the project
requirements page (linked at the top of the page) before scheduling the meeting.
These required components must be completed, submitted in Canvas, and submitted
in Oncehub or your project review will be canceled by the reviewer.

To schedule your review, please see the lesson entitled [Flex] Instructor
Review: Phase 1 Project and use the link provided to select an available date
and time on the scheduling site. Do not book an appointment with your assigned
Cohort Lead — be sure to choose another reviewer.

## What To Expect From the Project Review

Project reviews are focused on preparing you for [technical interviews][]. Treat
project reviews as if they were technical interviews, in both attitude and
technical presentation.

During your project review, be prepared to:

1. Walk through the app and showcase all the functionality you built. In this
   section, we want to make sure you satisfied all the requirements as well as
   best practices. (~10 minutes)
2. Explain your code from execution point to exit point. You will also be asked
   questions that test your knowledge of JS fundamentals. Use the best technical
   vocabulary you can. We'll help you with the words you can't remember or those
   you find difficult to pronounce. (~15-20 minutes)
3. Refactor code and add new functionality. (~15-20 minutes)

If any requirements are missing or if significant gaps in understanding are
found, be prepared to do one or all of the following:

- Extend the application with a new feature, more data, a different domain etc.
- Submit an improved version
- Meet again for another Project Review

If the session reaches an hour in length, the assessment will end at that point.

What won't happen:

- You won't be yelled at, belittled, or scolded
- You won't be put on the spot without support
- There's nothing you can do to instantly fail or blow it

## What is Expected of you in a Project Review

Since Project Reviews are preparing you for [technical interviews][], we expect
you to treat the session as a professional engagement. This is what is expected
of you:

- Your camera must be on
- Please secure a quiet environment
- Make sure that you have a stable internet connection
- You must meet the project requirements as follows or your project review will
  be canceled prior to taking place:
  - All project requirements
  - Github link submitted on Canvas and ScheduleOnce
  - Blog link submitted on Canvas and ScheduleOnce
  - Video link submitted on Canvas and ScheduleOnce
  - A good quality README
  - Blog must address a technical topic and be at least a 3 minute read
  - Video must not exceed 3 minutes in length
- You may not use notes
- You may only use a single screen
- Expect that you may need to repeat your assessment attempt
- This is a mock technical interview modeled off of a technical job interview
- Expect to receive helpful feedback that will help drive your coding skills

## Welcome to my Phase-1 Project!

I used the D&D 5th Edition API to make this character generator with the hopes of eventually creating a small "choose your own adventure" game out of it. Currently it is able to display a rudimentary character sheet that you can randomize to fill out a character (or hero, as I will eventually use for the story generator) sheet. The character sheet contains everything a budding adventurer would need to embark on a classic Dungeons and Dragons adventure.

As it stands there is functionality to save a character you like, as well as re-roll any of the randomized fields that you are not particularly fond of. I have also tagged on a search bar that displays information from the API directly on the page for quick searches if you need a refresher of some of the elements of D&D.

Eventually this project will be the base for a custom, random story generator. The idea being that you use the randomized hero that you rolled up to adventure through a few partially random storylines culminating in an epic battle just like you do in the table-top.

## How To Run

Because the project only used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as well as asynchronous functions to get/post to the API, the only thing the user needs to to is fork this repository, clone it, and then launch the HTML file in the repo. I intend to eventually utilize github.io to host the HTML file through github for even easier usage.

## Acknowledgments

Just wanted to expressly thank the team at the open Dungeons and Dragons 5e API - http://www.dnd5eapi.co
Without their help and thorough documentation this would not have been even remotely possible.
